// READ BEFORE YOU START:
// This program begins by displaying a menu to the user with options to add a movie, delete a movie, and search for a movie in a list. Your job is to implement the
// add(), search(), recommendation(), and delete_one() functions. Each has specific instructions included in comments above of the function. You will be doing all
// of this using a linked list, unlike in hw05 where you were using an array of structures. You should begin by tracing the helper function that is already
// implemented for you. Not only will this help you in understanding how to define and use pointers, it will help you understand what this program does.
// You should not change any of the code that you are given, only implement code where you are asked.

// Q1: add (15)
// Similar to hw05, you will be inserting into a list of movies sorted by their rating.
// Differing from hw05, there is no limit to how many movies can be in this list.
// "list" is initialized as NULL. Use this as your 'head' of the list and insert into it accordingly.
// There are 4 possibilities for inserting into the list:
//	- inserting into an empty list
//	- inserting at the beginning of the list
//	- inserting inbetween 2 nodes in the list
//	- inserting at the end of the list
// The short segment of code is given to you to help you get started. You will need to define new variables and pointers as needed.
//
// If a movie with the same rating already exists in the list, you should replace that position with the new movie, and move that movie to the next position.
//
// For example, if you have the list that contains:
//
//	Movie: The Hunger Games
//	Rating: 8
//
//	Movie: Mission Impossible
//	Rating: 7
//
// And you were to add the movie "The Sound of Music" with a rating of 8, your new list should be:
//
//	Movie: The Sound of Music
//	Rating: 8
//
//	Movie: The Hunger Games
//	Rating: 8
//
//	Movie: Mission Impossible
//	Rating: 7

// Q2: search (10)

// You need to return a pointer to a node in your list that contains that movie's information (name and rating)
// (You must return a pointer to a node in your list! Do not create a temporary pointer that just includes the name and rating, it will fail test cases!)

// Stored inside the location this pointer is pointing to, is the name of the movie that you want to delete from your list (movie->name)
// Because the search function is called before this function to see if the movie exists, you can assume that the movie exists in the list.
// You will need to find the movie and delete it using proper memory management to ensure no memory leaks.
